 My name is Nyack Johnson, I'm 18 years old , and i come from Millville, New Jersey ( even though Millville wasn't orignally  where i use to live).
I attended Millville Senior High during COVID-19 which meant, for freshman year, i had to stay at home and  do my schoolwork not because i was sick, but because i chose to stay home rather than go in-person, and for my sophomore year i was required to wear a mask.
Orignially, i was raised most of my life in Vineland , but at 6th grade, I moved to Millvile where i stayed and  attended both middle and high school , and I'm not the type to talk to others.
I don't have many hobbies besides sketching but that's more of a pasttime hobby as long as I'm not being bombareded with homework, quizes, midterems, or even exam ( on the same week).
I'm 6 ft 2 or 3 inches give or take , and I'm the first in my family to attend college ( since I'm the eldest of 3 children), also I was top 10% in my school which doesn't really matter right now.
